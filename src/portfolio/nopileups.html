            Car Wash Anti-Collision
        </h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://drb.com/tunnel_solutions/tunnel_management/nopileups_full_tunnel_optimization">NoPileups</a> is a car wash anti-collision service. It uses computer vision to stop the conveyor before accidents happen. The startup created a new <i>tunnel management</i> category in the industry and was acquired by <a href="https://drb.com/tunnel_solutions/tunnel_management/nopileups_full_tunnel_optimization">DRB Systems</a> in 2018.

        When I joined the team as <b>Sales & Marketing Director</b>, the service was running in a handful of early-adopter sites. We thought we were selling a car wash safety product, and nobody seemed interested outside of our early-adopter bubble. Our lead investor, and car wash hall-of-famer, knew collisions were a big problem for most operators. The problem is nobody wanted to admit <i>their</i> site had a problem.

        Value Proposition Pivot
    </h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Car wash collisions were the industry's dirty little secret. Operators were <b>reluctant to discuss the problem</b> because it meant admitting weakness a competitor may take advantage of. Something had to change for our service to appeal to the industry's mainstream.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">In a turn of luck, the support team began noticing a pattern among the operators of early-adopter sites. Noboby was talking about safety. Yes, safety mattered, but operators were most excited about increasing production. They found NoPileups let them wash more cars during peak hours.</p>
    <p class="mb-6">The tagline <b>Wash More Cars</b> was born from this insight. We flipped from a pain-driven value proposition to one driven by <i>gain</i>, and everything changed. Car wash operators were excited to talk about the new thing they could use to make more money. Even more importantly they were excited to tell their peers about the new service they were using to grow productivity.</p>
